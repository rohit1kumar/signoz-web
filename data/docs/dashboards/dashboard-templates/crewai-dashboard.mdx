title: Crew AI Dashboard
description: Monitor Crew AI workflows and performance including token consumption, crew and agent execution times, task distribution, and per-tool performance trends for optimal AI agent observability.
---

This dashboard offers a clear view into Crew AI workflows and performance. It highlights key metrics such as token consumption, crew and agent execution times, task distribution, and per-tool performance trends. Teams can monitor which agents and tasks are most active, track latency patterns, and identify optimization opportunities to improve reliability and efficiency across their Crew AI deployments.

## What This Dashboard Monitors

This dashboard tracks critical performance metrics for your Crew AI workflows using OpenTelemetry to help you:

- **Monitor Token Consumption**: Track input tokens (user prompts) and output tokens (model responses) to monitor system workload, efficiency trends, and consumption across different Crew AI workflows.
- **Track Crew Performance**: Monitor the average total execution time for each Crew run to understand workflow duration, spot inefficiencies, and evaluate the impact of optimizations.
- **Analyze Agent Performance**: Track execution time and task distribution per agent to identify performance trends, workload imbalances, and optimization opportunities.
- **Monitor Tool Efficiency**: Observe execution time for each tool to reveal performance patterns, inefficiencies, or changes in tool responsiveness.
- **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Observe token consumption trends over time to spot adoption curves, peak cycles, and unusual spikes in Crew AI activity.
- **Understand Workflow Structure**: View all Agent and Task spans within Crew executions, with direct links to trace spans for detailed inspection of execution flow.

## Metrics Included

### Token Usage Metrics
- **Total Token Usage (Input & Output)**: Displays the split between input tokens (user prompts) and output tokens (model responses), showing exactly how much work the system is doing over time.
- **Token Usage Over Time**: Time series visualization showing token consumption trends to identify adoption patterns, peak cycles, and baseline activity.

### Performance & Reliability
- **Average Duration of Crew**: Displays the average total execution time for each Crew run from start to completion, helping teams understand workflow duration and identify inefficiencies.
- **Duration Over Time (Per Agent)**: Shows how execution time of specific agents changes over time, revealing performance trends, slowdowns, or improvements.
- **Duration Over Time (Per Tool)**: Tracks execution time of specific tools over time to identify performance patterns and inefficiencies in tool responsiveness.
- **Average Time Per Agent**: Displays average task execution time for each agent to compare efficiency and identify where performance improvements may be needed.
- **Average Time Per Tool**: Shows average execution time for each tool to highlight efficiency and identify tools that may need optimization.

### Usage Analysis
- **Agents and Tasks**: Lists all Agent and Task spans within Crew executions, with each entry linking directly to its corresponding trace span for quick navigation and detailed inspection.
- **Tasks Per Agent**: Shows the number of tasks executed by each agent, providing a clear view of workload distribution and helping identify which agents handle the most activity.
- **Token Usage Over Time**: Time series visualization showing token consumption trends to identify adoption patterns, peak cycles, and baseline activity across Crew AI workflows.
