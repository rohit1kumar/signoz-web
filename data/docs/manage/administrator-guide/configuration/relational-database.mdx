title: Configuring SigNoz to Use Relational Databases
description: Learn how to configure SigNoz to use Relational Databases
---

SigNoz ships with SQLite by default for quick setups. For production and larger deployments, you can configure SigNoz to use a relational database. 

<Admonition type="info">
SigNoz uses a relational database like SQLite, Postgres exclusively for storing metadata and control-plane information, such as organizations, users, dashboards, and configurations. 

**It does not replace ClickHouse, which remains necessary for storing and querying all observability telemetry data  (traces, metrics, and logs).**
</Admonition>

## Configuration

Set the `SIGNOZ_SQLSTORE_PROVIDER` environment variable to select the database backend. See [configuration options](/docs/operate/configuration#environment-variables) for details.

### PostgreSQL

To use PostgreSQL, set the following environment variables on the `signoz` service:

```yaml
SIGNOZ_SQLSTORE_PROVIDER: postgres
SIGNOZ_SQLSTORE_POSTGRES_DSN: postgres://signoz:your_password@postgres:5432/signoz?sslmode=disable
```
- Ensure the specified database already exists and the user has privileges to create and migrate tables.
