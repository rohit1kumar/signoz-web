Starting this one off on a different chord!

Startups are challenging yet fulfilling. There is always a long road ahead - full of challenges and uncertainties. Yet, sometimes we hit a milestone and feel nostalgic about the journey completed. 10,000+ GitHub stargazers seemed like a distant dream, but finally, it’s here. Moments like these are special to the team. We are grateful to the developer community for their continued support since our inception.

Last month, we also shipped our first Enterprise edition - another big milestone. Our team also worked on performance benchmarks for logs.

Let us see what humans of SigNoz were up to in the month of October 2022!

## What we shipped?

We have been working on our enterprise edition, and last month we shipped our first edition.

<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.11.2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >Latest Release v0.11.2</a>

### Our first Enterprise Edition

Our first enterprise edition comes with SSO and SAML for our users. SSO and SAML support are essential for our users to enable smooth team collaboration while maintaining a secure authentication process, and many of our community members have requested these features.

Using SAML, teams can access multiple web applications using one set of login credentials.

### Performance Benchmarks

We released Logs support in <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.11.0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >v0.11.0</a>. We have spent some more time improving the performance and doing performance benchmarks. We are seeing some good performance numbers in terms of resource utilization. We have also made some comparisons with other open source tools like Elastic and Loki. We will be releasing a blog soon with these findings.

We are conducting office hours to discuss logs performance benchmarks and to take in feedback from the community.

Date & Time: Wednesday, 09 Nov 17:00 - 17:45 GMT+5:30

## What’s upcoming?

Our team is working on enhancing SigNoz capabilities as a one-stop observability solution. We now support metrics, traces, and logs under a single pane of glass. Developers use SigNoz to debug issues in their applications quickly. We are working to enable our users to access contextual information faster. Some of the things that we are gathering requirements for:

- Linking logs from traces and vice-versa
- Creating metrics from logs

If you'd like to share any ideas on enabling better correlation between signals, you can initiate a <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/discussions/1694" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub discussion</a>.

We are also gathering requirements on making things easier for our new users with default dashboards and templates. Some examples:

- Default host metrics, Kubernetes, and OTel collector dashboards
- Default APM alerts

We are collaborating with our community members to understand their use cases better. If you’d like to share your use cases, you can either initiate a <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/discussions/1695" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub discussion</a> or join our <a href = "https://signoz.io/slack" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >slack community</a>.

## Featured Issue

**Configuring application health check endpoint**

Applications have health check API endpoints that return the health of the applications. A community member has requested a way to configure this easily with SigNoz. The user wants to monitor the health check API endpoint with SigNoz, and send notifications to Slack whenever the endpoint is down.

If you have any ideas on how to enable this with SigNoz, feel free to comment on the <a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/1682" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >GitHub issue</a>.

## From the Blog

We launched support for logs in [v0.11.0](https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/releases/tag/v0.11.0). We use OpenTelemetry for collecting and processing logs. Logs have the biggest legacy among the three telemetry signals(metrics, traces, and logs). Unlike traces and metrics, OpenTelemetry logs take a different approach. OpenTelemetry aims to support the existing legacy of logs and logging libraries. And this is the main design philosophy of OpenTelemetry logs.

But it is not limited to this. With time, OpenTelemetry aims to integrate logs better with other signals. Read our guide on OpenTelemetry logs with instructions on how to collect log data.
