Welcome to our monthly product newsletter - SigNal 24!

Last month, our team worked on the upcoming trace and logs explorer page. With the new update, our users will be able to drive deeper insights into their application performance quickly.

We also attended open source focused meetups and published a cost comparison blog comparing SigNoz with other popular observability tools.

Let’s dive in to see what humans at SigNoz were up to in the month of April 2023.

## What we’re working on?

We’re working on building a new trace explorer and a log explorer page. The new explorer pages will give our users much more granular control over querying logs and trace data.

There are also multiple views like List, Time Series, and Table view for a much better user experience. With powerful filtering, aggregation, and group-by capabilities, you can make dive deeper into your observability data like never before.

Similarly, the logs explorer page comes with updated filtering capabilities, multiple views, and the ability to create metrics from logs to plot them.

## Shocking Datadog bill of \$65 million

Last week Datadog had its Q1 earnings call. It was revealed that they charged a cryptocurrency company a bill of \$65 million USD. A <a href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35837330" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>Hacker News thread</b></a> discussing the report went viral, and there was an outpour of user stories around Datadog’s unpredictable billing practices.

A lot of users also pointed out how the sales team of Datadog relentlessly pursue engineers for signing up for their services.

We have come across many other horror stories around Datadog billing while interacting with our users. We recently did a [deep dive into pricing](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/) to compare the cost of SigNoz compared to other observability tools.

Datadog's billing has two key issues:

- Very complex SKU-based pricing, which makes it impossible to predict how much it would cost.
- Custom metrics billing (\$0.05 per custom metric) - we found that custom metrics can account for [up to 52% of the total billing](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-limits-on-custom-metrics-with-signoz), which just does not make sense.

## SigNoz provides up to 9x more value for money than Datadog

We did a cost analysis of SigNoz and compared it with other vendors like DataDog, New Relic, and Grafana. SigNoz can provide up to 9x more value for money than vendors like Datadog and let your engineering team do so much more.

At SigNoz, we strive to provide the most value for your money. Check out the entire blog [here](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/).

## Featured Issue

<a href = "https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz/issues/2600" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>Monitoring Query service</b></a>

Our query service talks to the ClickHouse DB to query telemetry data and is a critical part of SigNoz architecture. The Query service APIs should be monitored for latency and memory usage to help debug issues. This will help make SigNoz more robust for production users.

### Attended ObservabilityCon and Open Source focused meetups

We attended the ObservabilityCon Bay Area meetup that took place in Palo Alto. It was exciting to see the interest in open source observability and hear about people’s experiences. At SigNoz, we believe open source observability is the way to go ahead.

We also attended an open source focused meetup organized by Heavybit, a dev tool focused venture capital. It was an interesting half-day conference in San Francisco where top leaders from the OSS world shared their insights.

### OpenTelemetry End-User Group Discussion

The team at SigNoz facilitates the monthly OpenTelemetry End-user group discussions for the APAC region. The OTel end-user group discussion is a place where you can discuss challenges related to OpenTelemetry implementations and learn from other OpenTelemetry users in a vendor-neutral space.

In our April session, we discussed evangelizing OpenTelemetry in a big organization and how to optimize observability data at scale. You can find the notes from the discussion <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDYC97LfvE428cpIf3A_hSGirdNzglPurlxgKCmw8o4/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" ><b>here</b></a>.

## From the blog

In 2018, RBI came out with a guideline on storing payment system data of Indian users. According to the guideline, all payment data need to be stored in data centers located in India. So how does this affect the performance monitoring of fintech applications?

The circular is applicable to all payment system providers authorized/approved by RBI to set up and operate a payment system in India. At SigNoz, we provide our users the option to host their data in India. Read on to find out more.
