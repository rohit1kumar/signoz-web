ServiceNow recently announced the [end-of-life (EOL) for Lightstep](https://docs.lightstep.com/changelog/eol-notice#heres-what-you-need-to-know), now known as Cloud Observability. Support will officially end on **March 1, 2026**, or at the end of your contract, and ServiceNow has confirmed there will be no direct replacement or migration path.

This news can be disruptive for engineering teams who rely on Lightstep for critical observability. The announcement highlights a significant risk in relying on proprietary, closed-source tools for essential infrastructure. 

At SigNoz we believe critical infra shouldn’t hinge on a vendor’s roadmap. Observability is too critical a piece to leave to such risks. With open source, you always have an escape hatch.

If you're now searching for a stable, future-proof alternative to Lightstep, you're in the right place. This guide will walk you through the best Lightstep alternatives, with a focus on open-source and OpenTelemetry-native solutions, and show you how to make a clean migration.

## What was Lightstep? A Quick Refresher

Lightstep was a powerful observability platform, highly regarded as an early leader in distributed tracing. Many engineering teams chose it for its:

* **Strong OpenTelemetry Support:** Lightstep was an early and significant contributor to OpenTelemetry (OTel), building its platform to provide first-class OpenTelemetry support. This meant users could instrument their applications with open standards, avoiding agent lock-in.
* **Unified Observability:** It provided unified dashboards to visualize logs, metrics, and traces in one place, which helped teams correlate different telemetry signals during an investigation.
* **Advanced Tracing Features:** It offered features like service diagrams, root cause analysis, and "Change Intelligence" to correlate performance deviations with deployments.

A good Lightstep alternative should ideally match or exceed these capabilities, providing a unified view of telemetry while being built on open standards.

## Top 6 Lightstep Alternatives

Here are the top alternatives to Lightstep, evaluated based on their support for logs, metrics, traces, open-source nature, and ease of migration.

### 1. SigNoz

## How to Migrate from Lightstep to SigNoz

Migrating from Lightstep to SigNoz is straightforward, thanks to OpenTelemetry. You won't need to change any code in your applications. The entire process involves re-configuring where your telemetry data is sent.

Here’s a simple 3-step guide:

### Step 1: Get Started with SigNoz

The quickest way to start is with [SigNoz Cloud](https://signoz.io/teams/). You can create an account in minutes and get a secure endpoint to send your data to. We offer a 30-day free trial account with access to all features.

Once you sign up, you'll find your ingestion details in the SigNoz UI under `Settings` -> `Ingestion Details`. You'll need the `Region` and `Ingestion Key`.

### Step 2: Reconfigure Your OpenTelemetry Collector

You are likely using an OpenTelemetry Collector to send data to Lightstep. To switch to SigNoz, you just need to update the exporter configuration in your collector's YAML file (`config.yaml`).

**Before (Lightstep Config):**

Your old configuration probably looked something like this:

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp/lightstep:
    endpoint: ingest.lightstep.com:443
    headers:
      "lightstep-access-token": "${LIGHTSTEP_ACCESS_TOKEN}"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/lightstep]
````

**After (SigNoz Config):**

Update the `exporters` section to point to the SigNoz Cloud endpoint for your region.

```yaml
exporters:
  otlp/signoz:
    # Replace <REGION> with your SigNoz cloud region
    # ex: us, in, eu
    endpoint: "ingest.<REGION>.signoz.cloud:443"
    headers:
      "signoz-ingestion-key": "${SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY}"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      # Switch the exporter to SigNoz
      exporters: [otlp/signoz]
```

Replace `<REGION>` with your actual SigNoz region (e.g., `us`, `eu`, or `in`) and set the `SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY` environment variable to your ingestion key from Step 1. After applying the new configuration, your telemetry will start flowing to SigNoz.

For a detailed guide, check out our documentation on [migrating from an existing OpenTelemetry setup](https://signoz.io/docs/migration/migrate-from-opentelemetry/cloud/).

### Step 3: Verify and Decommission

We recommend running both platforms in parallel for a short period. Once you've verified that all your data is flowing correctly into SigNoz and have recreated any necessary dashboards or alerts, you can safely decommission your Lightstep integration.

While migrating from Lightstep to any other platform, there are a few important caveats to keep in mind:

- **Dashboards & Alerts:** Existing dashboards, alerts, and saved queries in Lightstep cannot be directly ported. Teams will need to rebuild these in the new system.
- **Collector Differences:** If you were using Lightstep’s older custom exporter (before OpenTelemetry became the standard), you may need to adjust or replace those configurations when switching to a pure OTLP pipeline.

Also note that historical data cannot be migrated from Lightstep to SigNoz. You will be starting fresh in the new system.

## Other Ways to Get Started with SigNoz

You can choose between various deployment options in SigNoz apart from SigNoz cloud (shown above). 

Those who have data privacy concerns and can't send their data outside their infrastructure can sign up for either [enterprise self-hosted or BYOC offering](https://signoz.io/contact-us/).

Those who have the expertise to manage SigNoz themselves or just want to start with a free self-hosted option can use our [community edition](https://signoz.io/docs/install/self-host/).

## Conclusion

The end-of-life for Lightstep is a significant event, but it's also an opportunity to move to a more resilient, open, and cost-effective observability stack. By choosing an OpenTelemetry-native platform like SigNoz, you not only find a safe landing place but also protect yourself from future vendor-driven disruptions. The migration is simpler than you might think, and the long-term benefits of owning your observability data are well worth the effort.
